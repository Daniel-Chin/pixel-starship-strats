Adaptive anti-shield
    crew AI: leave room when enemy shield is down. 
    room AI: use `if crew in room` denote whether enemy shield has been dissolved. 
power switch from anti-shield + TLP to lasers + MD. 

Kill crew:
    if target has friend: random
    if target has enemy: stay
    if target == 100%: TLP
        // after hitting TLP it is no longer 100%
    random

Kill crew (alternative):
    if target has friend: random
    if target == 100%: TLP
        // after hitting TLP it is no longer 100%
    if target no enemy: random
    if target has enemy: stay
    shield
        // when target is NULL

Bugs:
    why do rooms target TLP evern when TLP < 100%? 
        (including the alternative)

archive
    if target < 100%: reactor
        // because reactor always == 100%, this refreshes
